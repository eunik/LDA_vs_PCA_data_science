# LDA vs PCA - Data Science
This code is based off a tutorial by [Sebastian Raschka](http://sebastianraschka.com/Articles/2014_python_lda.html), on analyzing the
 linear discriminant done by a PCA approach and LDA approach.  
The only difference is that this code uses another database and will analyze 8 features.
